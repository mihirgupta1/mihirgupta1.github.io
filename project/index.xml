      <description>1. Introduction Please note, I have imported the same datasets from project 1, and have copied the same wrangling and tidying from project 1 to use for project 2.
I have chosen four datasets. The first dataset, called casedata contains the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by county in the state of Texas from the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. I got this data from the Texas Department of State Health Services.</description>
